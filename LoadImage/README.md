# This is my README

# This is java code which serves as an introduction to my Jr. Explorer's in Art project. 
#
# Jr. Explorers in Art is a 3-6 class art curriculum for students, grades Pre-K-3rd.  It is designed to be either taught at home for Home Schooled children, or in School by a parent or a volunteer. 
#
# This Java project loads the critical images of the curriculum.  By selecting the appropriate buttons with the painting's name, the correct painting and critical information about the painting, is displayed.   
#
# Files : 
# LoadImageApplet.java - applet loader, sets the dimension and makes visible :  
# ImagePanel - a verticle BoxLayout of three panes(in top down order) : CurrentViewableImage, TextFieldInformation, and ClickableImagePanel 
#
# CurrentViewableImage - displays paintings that were selected in ClickableImagePanel
# TextFieldInformation - displays information on each painting viewed 
# ClickableImagePanel - allows user to click a button containing the image name, and that result is manifested in both CurrentViewableImage and also TextFieldInformation
#
#
# Suggestions of alternations to project : 
# 1. Alter CurrentViewableImage.java : Scale (via Spline/Vector) the painting (top pane), so that areas of interest within the painting are zoomed or retracted on click. 
#
# 2. Alter CurrentViewableImage.java : Add a scroll pane to the painted window so that on Zoom the entire painting remains visible. 
#
# 3. Alter ClickableImagePanel.java :  Alter the buttons below so that buttons become image icon's of the painting themselves, and the clicker is clicking painting of interest.
